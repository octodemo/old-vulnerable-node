# What's this project?

The goal of this project is to be a project with really vulnerable code in NodeJS, not simulated.

## Why?

Similar project, like OWASP Node Goat, are pretty and useful for learning process but not for a real researcher or studding vulnerabilities in source code, because their code is not really vulnerable but simulated.

This project was created with the **purpose of have a project with identified vulnerabilities in source code with the finality of can measure the quality of security analyzers tools**.

Although not its main objective, this project also can be useful for:

- Pentesting training.
- Teaching: learn how NOT programming in NodeJS.

The purpose of project is to provide a real app to test the quality of security source code analyzers in white box processing.

## How?

This project simulates a real (and very little) shop site that has identifiable sources points of common vulnerabilities.

## Installation

The most simple way to run the project is using docker-compose, doing this:

```bash

# git clone https://github.com/cr0hn/vulnerable-node.git vulnerable-node
# cd vulnerable-node/
# docker-compose build && docker-compose up
Building postgres_db
Step 1 : FROM library/postgres
---> 247a11721cbd
Step 2 : MAINTAINER "Daniel Garcia aka (cr0hn)" <cr0hn@cr0hn.com>
---> Using cache
---> d67c05e9e2d5
Step 3 : ADD init.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
....
```

## Running

Once docker compose was finished, we can open a browser and type the URL: `127.0.0.1:3000` (or the IP where you deployed the project):
